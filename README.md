What will the application do?  
- This application is a text based game that involves moving a player from one location
to the next. The player has the ability to decide what the character does from the 
options that are provided. The in-game decisions a character makes, determine the
how difficult the challenges within the game will be. For example, the weapon a player
initially chooses can have a big impact on the scalability of how difficult a challenge is.


Who will use it?
- This project can be used by any person who wants to play a simple text based game.
It provides the same joy and frustration found within in any game, thus it is available
for people of all ages.

Why is this project of interest to you?
- This specific project interest me because I am a long-time electronical game player
, and now I was given the opportunity to express my own thoughts and ideas into a playable game.
For that reason, "I jumped the gun" at the chance to design my own game.
